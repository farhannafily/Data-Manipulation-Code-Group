**Object Series**
In pandas module, there is two object, series and data frame. Object Series just have single dimension data, in other words doesn't have column number but only have index
**loc and iloc**
When we try to call an index or more dataframe using the usual method, the result might cause some inconsistency. In that case we utilize loc and iloc. Loc for explicit index while iloc for implicit index

**dataframe**
Data Frame is a collection of series, with at least one series.
